# Current Issue: Save Functionality Failing

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: User is not authenticated (session is null), so all Supabase operations fail due to RLS policies.

## Evidence from Console Logs
```
GoTrueClient session from storage null
#getSession() session from storage null  
INITIAL_SESSION callback session null
```

## Why Save is Failing
1. **Authentication Required**: Supabase RLS policies require authenticated users
2. **Admin Check Failing**: `CrosswordService.isAdmin()` returns false when no user is authenticated
3. **Database Operations Blocked**: All `supabase.from()` operations fail without authentication

## Current State
- ✅ Database schema is correct
- ✅ RLS policies are properly configured  
- ✅ Auto-save functionality is implemented
- ❌ User needs to login first before any save operations work

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Login First (Recommended for Production)
User needs to:
1. Go to `/auth` page  
2. Login with Google OAuth
3. Ensure user is in `user_roles` table with admin role
4. Then try saving

### Option 2: Development Bypass (For Testing Only)
Temporarily disable RLS policies for testing:

```sql
-- ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT TESTING
ALTER TABLE crossword_games DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE crossword_questions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_roles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Option 3: Test User Auto-Login
Add development-only auto-login for testing purposes.

## Next Steps
1. **For immediate testing**: User should login via `/auth` first
2. **For production**: Ensure proper authentication flow
3. **For development**: Consider adding test user auto-login mode

## Files Status
- `src/lib/crosswordService.ts` - ✅ Working correctly, just needs authenticated user
- `src/app/components/QuestionManager.tsx` - ✅ Auto-save implemented correctly  
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - ✅ Admin protection working as intended

**The save functionality is actually working correctly - it just requires authentication first!**
